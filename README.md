# Coursera_IBM_Data_Engineering
 Master SQL, RDBMS, ETL, Data Warehousing, NoSQL, Big Data and Spark with hands-on job-ready skills

In this course, i have the opportunity to immerse myrself in the role of a data engineer and acquire the essential skills you need to work with a range of tools and databases to design, deploy, and manage structured and unstructured data.  


After few weeks of training, I completed hands-on labs and projects to help me gain practical experience with Python, SQL, relational databases, NoSQL databases, Apache Spark, building data pipelines, managing databases, and working with data warehouses.

These are the projects that I got to do :

• Design a relational database to help a coffee franchise improve operations

• Use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic data sets.

• Write a Bash shell script on Linux that backups changed files.

• Set up, test, and optimize a data platform that contains MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM Db2 databases.

• Analyze road traffic data to perform ETL and create a pipeline using Airflow and Kafka.

• Design and implement a data warehouse for a solid-waste management company.

• Move, query, and analyze data in MongoDB, Cassandra, and Cloudant NoSQL databases.

• Train a machine learning model by creating an Apache Spark application.

• Design, deploy, and manage an end-to-end data engineering platform.
